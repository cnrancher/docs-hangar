title: "Sync Command"
---

The sync command syncs the extra container images into the cache folder created by [Save](/v1.6/save/save) command.

## Background

There may some images failed to save when running Save command, the save failed image list will output into `save-failed.txt`. You can use Sync command to re-save these images into `saved-image-cache` folder and use [Compress](/v1.6/advanced/compress) to re-compress the tarball.

Besides, the [decompress](/v1.6/advanced/decompress) command supports to decompress the tarball created by hangar same as the decompress part of [hangar load](/v1.6/load/load) command.

## QuickStart

Re-save the images in `saved-failed.txt` into `saved-images-cache` folder:

```sh
hangar sync -f ./saved-failed.txt -d ./saved-images-cache -j 10
```

> Sync failed images will output to `sync-failed.txt`
