title: "Archive File Format"
---

Hangar uses the `zip` format archive file since version `v1.7.0`.

:::warning

**The archive file created by older versions of hangar (`tar.gz`) are no longer compatible with new versions (`zip`).**

You can use [hangar v1.6](/docs/v1.6/load/load) to load the old `tar.gz` format archive file.

:::

You can use [load](/docs/v1.8/load/load) command to load images from archive file to registry server.

And you can also use the [hangar archive](/docs/v1.8/archive/) command to operate with the archive file.
- [hangar archive ls](/docs/v1.8/archive/ls): List the images in the archive file.
- [hangar archive merge](/docs/v1.8/archive/merge): Merge multiple archive files into a new archive file.
- [hangar archive export](/docs/v1.8/archive/export): Export images from archive file.

## Why using zip format?

Compared with the compressed tarball (`tar.gz`) format, the `zip` archive format contains a file index ([directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Structure)) so it allows reading files from the `zip` archive randomly, and it also allows appending new files into the `zip` archive without decompressing and re-create the entire archive file. So Hangar 1.7 changed to `zip` archive format to avoid extra disk storage usage when saving/loading/syncing container images.

Therefore, this will cause Hangar to no longer support `tar.gz` format compressed tarball, and the old `saved-image-cache` directory will no longer exists.


## Different with `docker save`

The archive file created by Hangar is not compatible with `docker save` or other tools (`podman`) archive files,
and currently the Hangar [load](/docs/v1.8/load/load) command only supports to upload container images to registry server.
It does not support export container images from archive file to docker daemon, CRI-O and containerd daemon protocol.

The file size of the archive file created by Hangar is similar (or much smaller) than archive files created by other tools.
In addition, Hangarâ€™s archive files supports storing multi-architecture & platform container images.
